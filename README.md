# hello-world
This is my first repository - learning GitHub
Hi! I am a second-year non-traditional student of Computer Science and Mathematics at a local community college. The breadth of knowledge that I've gained over three semesters' worth of work has been astounding. Now that I have time before my last semester at the college, I've devoted time to learning as much about web-based technologies as possible before taking on the responsibilites of my course load again. Tonight, I wanted to look a little at Git-Hub and do a few introductory exercises.
